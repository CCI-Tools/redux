# redux for Python

This repository comprises a very basic, but already useful Python implementation of the [redux.js](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) 
library initiated by [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon).

It was created while watching the fantastic 
[Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux) tutorial.
